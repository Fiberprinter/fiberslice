Description:
The commit introduced updates to the two modules “addons.rs” and “force_analytics.rs” as well as the main file “main.rs” and the prelude file “prelude.rs”. The primary goal of the commit is to complete the “item_wrapper macro typeeq finished” and fix the problem with the “stripbuilder”.

Changes Made:
• In the “addons.rs” module, the method create_addon_strip_builder() was modified to include a new argument “ctx” and support for a new function “orientation::show()”. The modifications allow for the creation of an OrientationAddon alongside ForceAnalyticsAddont that shows the orientation of a design. The method also now accepts two new mutable references; gui_interface and item_wrapper, which are used to pass data to the “orientation::show()” function.
• In both the “addons.rs” and “force_analytics.rs” modules, the builder methods were modified to use new macros from the “item_wrapper” module.
• In the main file “main.rs”, the color used for the material was changed.
• In the prelude file “prelude.rs”, the “TypeEq” trait was modified to accept the type “T”.
